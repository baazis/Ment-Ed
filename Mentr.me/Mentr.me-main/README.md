# Mentr.me

The recent COVID pandemic has disrupted many sectors, especially the educational and industrial sectors. The enormous number of layoffs due to COVID19 and difficulties faced by students due to the closing down of their institutes inspired us to do something about it

Mentr.me brings the two sectors together to better equip them for a competitive job market. With their verified credentials, now the ex-employees can upgrade their skills by mentoring students and in-turn get noticed by recruiters! Students get to work on hands-on projects under these skilled mentors to thrive in a competitive job market.

Mentors earn a small amount as a reward and gain points for helping out students with their projects. Top performers get to have a 1:1 virtual coffee chat with a recruiter.

Students can verify their skills by taking our assessments and earn scratchcards to win tickets to global conferences! Students are also encouraged to help out their peers and gain points to get referrals!

Recruiters get to network with potential candidates with proven skills as demonstrated by their mentorships.

 ### Chatbot 
 
The new reality of prolonged quarantine period and lack of socialization with other family members, friends, and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are all challenging for each one of us. A lot of students and ex-employers are stressed and at a verge of depression, More than 50% of those suffering from mental health issues are not seeking treatment, due to social stigma. This present environment in the world has increased stress and anxiety amongst the people.

We also implemented a chatbot to provide assistance and support for our users

# Why Mentr.me: The innovation and social impact

**1. Students**

As students, we often find it difficult to find the resource from the plethora of online content. We find hours surfing through the web, to find a solution for a small issue. It would be a great help for students like us to get a mentor for helping us to develop a project at an affordable price. Since most of our educational institutes are closed, we find it difficult to find someone to help us out

Mentr.me gives students an opportunity to connect to mentors from different parts of the part, at an affordable price. Mentr.me also works as a peer to peer network, that lets students help each other out. 

**2. Ex employers**

A lot of employers have lost their job due to the recent COVID pandemic. They spend hours surfing the web to find the right job and to get an additional source of income. This lockdown also provides them ample time to give back to society by helping the younger mentees out there

Mentr.me provides them with an opportunity to earn an additional income and a chance to help the young developers who are seeking their help. This would also help them sharpen/revise their skills. Also through the platform top-performing candidates,  gets an opportunity to land in an interview with a recruiter of their choice
