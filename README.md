An E-learning web portal for students, mentors and recruiters!

# PPT of IDEA - Devspace Ment-ED2.pdf (in files above)


# MOTIVATION-
1. The recent COVID pandemic has disrupted many sectors, especially the
educational and industrial sectors. The enormous number of layoffs due to
COVID19 and difficulties faced by students due to the closing down of their
institutes inspired us to do something about providing users with the best
opportunities virtually.
2. A lot of employers have lost their job due to the recent COVID pandemic. They
spend hours surfing the web to find the right job and to get an additional
source of income. This lockdown also provides them ample time to give back
to society by helping the younger students out there and earn money.
3. Students find it difficult during lockdown to have proper mentorship regarding
studies and they spend a lot of time on internet finding the right resources
and solutions even for a small issue. It would be a great help for students to
get a mentor for helping them to develop skills and project.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT-
1- Our E-learning portal gives students an opportunity to connect to mentors
from different parts of the world and to learn from their experiences. It will
also works as a peer to peer network, that lets students help each other out
through a community of similar interest.
2. This portal provides ex-employers with an opportunity to earn an
additional income and a chance to help the young students and developerswho are seeking their help. This would also help them sharpen/revise their
skills. Also through the platform top-performing candidates, gets an
opportunity to land in an interview with a recruiter of their choice.
3. Recruiters find to hard to find the right candidates from the plethora of
applicants. Our Portal provides recruiters the opportunity to connect with our
top-performing candidates (who have passed our skill verification test). Thus
instead of taking the hazzle of going through long process of hiring, the
recruiters can go through the handful of potential candidates on this portal by
accepting to connect with them.

# NOVELTY-
1. Students can directly intern under their own mentors and after passing
particular test/level they can apply for job with some of their known recruiters
based on a point system.
2. Users can post about the project idea they need assistance/help for (or any
other issue they want help in) . Other users experienced in the related
technologies can choose to work on these projects/issues as a team member
or as a mentor and can review the progress using this portal.
3. Users can maintain a timetable for all the courses and tests and get reminders
before the scheduled time. They can also get their skills verified by taking skill
tests and if they perform well, they receive amazing gifts for like event passes,
vouchers, scratch cards etc.
4. Recruiters can look into shortlisted top candidate's/employers profile who
applied and accept to connect with these potential candidates. And if
convinced, they can directly offer an interview for any of the current job
openings in their firm.
5. A community maintained for similar minded people like Student community,
Employer community, Recruiter community and a common platform to
connect all three.

# BUSINESS ASPECT-
1. This will connect all three students, mentors and recruiter at a single
place.
2. Students will get their mentors easily and fast.3. Effective Employee Onboarding :Mentors/ex employers can get an
additional source of income and a chance to help their mentees.
